# SETUP-NESTJS-AUTH-POSTGRESS

This is a demo project showcasing a JWT-based authentication server built with NestJS and postgress. The server provides endpoints for user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Features

- User sign-up with email and password
- User sign-in with email and password
- Authentication using JWT
- Authorization using a JWT guard
- User data stored on in the Postgresql DB
- Get recent blogs endpoint (protected by JWT guard)
- Get posts endpoint

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- npm (v6 or above)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/haxhmi1993/setup-nestjs-auth-postgres.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd setup-nestjs-auth-postgres

3. install the dependencies

    npm install

4. Set up the environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and configure the following variables:

PORT=***************
JWT_SECRET=*********
MONGODB_URI=********
DB_HOST=************
DB_PORT=************
DB_USERNAME=********
DB_PASSWORD=********
DB_NAME=************

5. start the application

npm run start


# Usage
## User Sign-up
    Endpoint: POST /auth/signup

    Create a new user by sending a POST request to the above endpoint with the following payload:
    {
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "password": "password123"
    }
## User Sign In
    
    Endpoint: POST /auth/signin

    Sign in a user by sending a POST request to the above endpoint with the following payload:      
    {
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "password": "password123"
    }

The response will include a JWT token that you can use for subsequent authenticated requests.

## Get Recent Blogs
    Endpoint: GET /blogs/recent

    Retrieve a list of recent blogs by sending a GET request to the above endpoint. This endpoint requires authentication using a JWT token.

    Include the JWT token in the Authorization header as follows:


    GET /blogs/recent HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:3000
    Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
## Get Posts
    Endpoint: GET /posts

    Retrieve a list of posts by sending a GET request to the above endpoint. No authentication is required for this endpoint.


    GET /posts HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:3000

## Security
    It is recommended to secure the application in a production environment by using secure environment variables, enabling HTTPS, and implementing additional security measures such as rate limiting and input validation.
